//fiber m list ki performance ko improve kerna bai toh using keys,keys should be "stable, unique and efficient";

// Fiber is a more advanced architecture introduced in React 16 that improves on VOM by allowing incremental, prioritized, and asynchronous rendering, leading to better performance and smoother user experiences
// Instead of updating the whole UI in one go, incremental rendering allows React to break the update into smaller chunks or units of work.
